<h3>There are many different types of iris.
Is it possible to distinguish between them based on their sepal and petal length and width?<br>
A dataset of measurements for the three iris species in the above image was collected that can help you decide yourself.<br>Take a look at the scatterplot visualization to find patterns in the measurements! Feel free to change the axes of the scatterplot and omit/include the different species to find different patterns.
